          <br><br>
          For many months and many years, Star Heads travel along their predetermined orbits through space. When they reach the end of their long journeys, they travel to this bar to ease their fatigue, make friends, and talk with the one who made them: their father, the Star Maker.
          <br><br>
          The bar is located on an open plain near the Crystal Mountain Range, north of the Glassy Ocean and Dr. Hoop's Artificial Moon. In the rare event that it cannot be found, the bar can be called from a telephone on the plain, after which it will descend from the sky. Inside the bar, there is a quiet and calming atmosphere.
          <br><br>
          The Altair Bar is almost famous for its two billion year-old sake, Starlight Spirit, which is something of a miracle cure for those Star Heads that have lost their luster, and whose light is fading.
