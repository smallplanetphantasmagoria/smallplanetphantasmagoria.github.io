        For many months and many years, the Star Heads travel along their predetermined orbits throughout space. For those whose long journeys have come to an end, they return, traveling to this bar to ease their travel fatigue, make friends, and talk with their father (creator).<br>
        <br>
        A place for Star Heads worn out from their journeys to breathe easy–a bar situated near the Crystal Mountain Range in an open plain. In the rare event that the bar cannot be found, it can be called from a telephone also in the plain, after which it will drop down from the sky. Inside the bar is a quiet and calming atmosphere. The place is almost famous for its two billion year-old sake, Starlight Spirits, that it serves. This brew serves as something of a silver bullet for Star Heads who have lost their luster and whose light is fading.<br>
        <br>
        Star Heads visit the place to rest their bodies in the Cosmic Ocean at the end of their travels and talk with their father, the one who created them–the Star Maker.<br>
        <br>
        Located near the ocean of glass, Glassy Ocean, and the Man-made Moon created by Dr. Hoop.<br>
