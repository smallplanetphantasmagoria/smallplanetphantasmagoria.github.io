          <br>
          A bakery made of bread itself. For a radius of several kilometers, an enticing scent wafts, leading to near-constant targeting by flocks of birds and mischiefs of rats. A lip-licking bakery made of bread—the scent of freshly baked bread hangs in the air in the relative vicinity. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The most popular bakery on all of Phantasmagoria, popular with even the birds and the rats, much to the bakers’ chagrin. Never knowing when the next raid by the critters will be, the bakers keep a sharp lookout at all times, making them constantly on edge. A dog was added to aid in keeping watch, but appears to also fear the rats. When not servicing the bread oven or other maintenance-related tasks, they will let visitors watch them bake the bread. You may want to take a look! Their most popular golden brown confection is ‘Pan de Queso,’ a cheese bread made with the magma cheese from Mt. Cheese.
