          <br>
          Phantasmagoria’s greatest amusement facility. In addition to films, shows Phantas News, which projects happenings from all across the planet. Nextdoor is a bookstore, with a wide array of Mr. Tamura’s books on display en masse. The planet’s greatest pastime—located to the South of the Digital Zone.

          Nearby is a bookstore, a full day’s worth of fun for visitors. The Cinematographie not only runs standard showings, but also reports on the day’s events and spreads information pertinent to the coming days in the form of Phantas News. For first-time tourists, the cinema is a must-do, with its news broadcasts serving as a welcome source of intel. At the bookstore, under the constant clamor of the radio, the bookworm of a shopkeeper is manning his shop. While he will be angered by those who stand around browsing his books, those who take care to do so more stealthy will fly under the radar of Mr. Lewes, owner of the store, as he is not as sharp as one might think. Popular volumes can be perused here.
