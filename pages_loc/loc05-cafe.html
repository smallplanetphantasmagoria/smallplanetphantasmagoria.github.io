          <br>
          Widely viewed as serving coffee with a terrible taste, but greatly popular among a select niche of deeply-rooted individuals. Part of a mummy tour course for unknown reasons.

          A cafe in the shape of a coffee pot—perhaps a quirky way to cover for the poor flavor of their coffee, as the rumors suggest. Bread made in the Hon’yara bakery, cookies from Cookie Town, and magma cheese from Mt. Cheese all feature on their menu, but the main feature remains their coffee, now without any sugar—‘Black Only’—as the sugar cube trees had a poor harvest. Nonetheless, Mr. Pint from the Planetarium, Dr. Hoop, and Prospector Jackal among several others are known to frequent the cafe on an almost daily basis despite their almost as frequent complaints about the coffee’s flavor. Furthermore, the area also seems to be located along a route for ships that run aboveground, being spottable from time to time. It is also said to be rest stop for mummy tourists passing through.
