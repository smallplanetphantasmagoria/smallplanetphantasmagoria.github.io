          <br>
          A valley in which a rainbow that becomes solid appears, serving as the raw ingredient for the color pigments produced by the factory. The colors produced here hold the reputation of being “capable of reproducing any color” among painters and artisans alike.

          A beautiful valley in which a rainbow appears—about 70km southwards of Dragon Mountain, a stunning valley in which a solidified rainbow is formed. A long time prior, painter Mr. R used the colors produced by this rainbow in his work, and, noting that they perfectly reproduced the colors found in nature, decided to create a pigment factory in the location. However, it is said that the factory itself is quite difficult to manage as when the rainbow disappears, factory work also grinds to a halt. A railroad—Pablo Light Railway—originally laid out for the purpose of transporting the colors into town serves the menial work of carrying droves of factory employees out to the town on days when there is no rainbow. The factory manager lamented this behavior, shooting sidelong glances at his employees entirely too engrossed in messing around, stating, “Our livelihoods depend on the rainbow, after all…”.
